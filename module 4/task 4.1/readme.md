# Answer to the question

## The switch lacks a WAN port, since it works only on the local network. The router is engaged in the transfer of data between different networks, and the switch cannot do this.
## The switch lacks Wi-Fi, it only switches packets on the Ethernet network.
## Perhaps the lack of remote control and, accordingly, all functions that can be configured, as well as statistics.
## A switch usually has more LAN ports than a router.
